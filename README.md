# OCB Enclosed Space Mod - 7 Days to Die (A20) Addon

This Mod tries to solve the issue that doors don't
block light, thus they also don't create enclosed
areas. Which is why it rains inside houses.

Note that this adds some additional calculations to
the light processor, which may or may not impact your
overall framerate and/or other aspects of the game.

It is only a proof of concept (work in progress)!
